# Overview

I set out to learn the fundamentals of the R language and data-analysis.

I created a program that will take historical data for any stock, calculate and create a list of the 50 day running averages, and 200 day running averages. It will also generate a graph for them. 

My purpose in writing this program was to have a way to compare the current stock prices with the 50 day running average to glean useful information for making buying or selling decisions.
